`half_window` effects
---------------------

This example shows the influence of the `half_window` parameter that is used when
fitting any morphological algorithm.

For this example, the :meth:`~.Baseline.mor` algorithm will be used, which is a relatively
robust baseline algorithm.

# %%
# For many morphology-based baseline algorithms, the optimal `half_window` value
# is approximately equal to the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the widest
# peak. We can calculate the FWHM of our synthetic data from the largest :math:`\sigma`
# value. The FWHM of a Gaussian distribution is related to its :math:`\sigma` value by
# the relationship: :math:`FWHM = 2 \sigma \sqrt{2 ln{2}} \approx 2.3548 \sigma`.
#
# The spacing of the x-values, :math:`dx` also has to be taken into account since the
# `half_window` value is index-based, while :math:`\sigma` is based on the x-values.
# Thus, the approximate FWHM is: :math:`FWHM \approx 2.3548 \sigma / dx`. Also note
# that `half_window` has to be an integer since it is index-based.
dx = np.diff(x).mean()  # set dx as the average of all the x-spacings
print(int(2.3548 * 12 / dx))

# %%
# Thus, a good `half_window` value is ~60. To investigate the effect of the
# `half_window` value, we will use 30, 60, and 120.
#
# Note that the actual :math:`\sigma` value for a peak is often unknown, so
# the FWHM value is usually estimated simply by looking at a plot of the data
# (using plt.plot(y)).
#

# %%
# Using a small `half_window` value makes the baseline cut into the larger peaks.

# Setting the `half_window` value as the approximate FWHM now fits the
# expected baseline without reducing the peak area.

# %%
# Now, put together all the results to show the change in the baseline
# as `half_window` increases. Note how the `half_window` value can be considered
# as the approximate "stiffness" of the baseline. For small `half_window` values,
# the baseline has more flexibility to fit inbetween the peaks, while the largest
# `half_window` value is too stiff to account for the localized curvature of the
# baseline.

# Finally, note that the effect of the larger `half_window` value is decreased
# if the baseline is relatively flat, so there is less of a penalty for using a
# larger `half_window` value on flat baselines.
